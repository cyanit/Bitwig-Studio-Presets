A collection of Bitwig Studio 2.x presets I made. Have fun!
Also avalible here: https://gum.co/bitwig-studio-presets

## Info
These are all presets I submitted to the monthly preset competition + a few more that are a bit smaller. If you have questions or ideas for improvements, don´t hesitate to ask me. You can find me on the Bitwig Community Discord, im almost always online (. Leo .).
These are intended for beginner and mediocre users that want more (different) sounds. 
If you make music with them, I´ll be happy if you let me know. Im interested in what you created!



## Synths (FM-4/Phase-4/Polysynth)
### Broken Operator (FM-4)
A fat, broken, brassy FM sound.

### Broken Phase Drift (Phase-4)
A broken, drifing phase distorion Bass that can sound metallic or warm.

### Analog Pluck (Polysynth)
A slightly pitch drifting pluck made with Bitwigs Polysynth.

### Big Pluck
A simple pluck with a shitton of reverb

### CNT-18
Plucky monophonic SAW that sounds interesting.

### CNT-32
More (hidden) OSCs, more voices (Polyphonic), more grit, more everything. Variant of the CNT-18. 

### Filtered Chords
Simple unison saw with an LFO on the filter. Make a chord progresseion and automate the LFO sync. You´ll Love it.

### Phoenix-8
A big, spacious synth that can do lush chords, quick stabs and bright plucks. USE THE SPACE KNOB!

### Polysynth v2 (Init)
A DIY synth. The idea is to have something to sketch out ideas fast. This synth evolved into a seperate Reaktor ensemble which will Ill release around cristmas. Stay tuned...

### Space Saw
NO need AT ALL for a description. Saw -> Reverb = Nice



## Audio Effects
### Adaptive Sub-Cleaner
An EQ that adjust itself based on a keytrack modulator. Nice if you are lazy and want to eq some unneeded shit out.

### Ambiance
An Ambinace Preset for the Reverb

### Amp Mk. 1
A little weird Guitar Amp I built.

## Note Effects
### Randomized Arp
Does what it sais. It´s a randomized arp.
