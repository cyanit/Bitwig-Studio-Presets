# Bitwig-Studio-Presets
A collection of Bitwig Studio 2.x presets

## Info
These are all Presets I submitted to the monthly preset competition + a few more that are a bit smaller. If you have questions or ideas for improvements, donÂ´t hesitate to ask me. You can find me on the Bitwig Community Discord, im almost always online.
These are intended for beginners and medioker users that want more/different sounds. 
So if you make music with them, ill be happy if you let me know. Im interested in what you created!
