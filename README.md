# Bitwig-Studio-Presets
A collection of Bitwig Studio 2.x presets

## Info
These are all Presets I submitted to the monthly preset competition + a few more that are a bit smaller. If you have questions or ideas for improvements, don´t hesitate to ask me. You can find me on the Bitwig Community Discord, im almost always online.
These are intended for beginners and medioker users that want more/different sounds. 
So if you make music with them, ill be happy if you let me know. Im interested in what you created!

## Synths (FM-4/Phase-4/Polysynth)
### Broken Operator (FM-4)
A fat, broken, brassy FM sound.

### Broken Phase Drift (Phase-4)
A broken, drifing phase distorion Bass that can sound metallic or warm.

### Analog Pluck (Polysynth)
A slightly pitch drifting pluck made with Bitwigs Polysynth.

### Big Pluck
A simple pluck with a shitton of reverb

### CNT-18
Plucky monophonic SAW that sounds interesting.

### CNT-32
More (hidden) OSCs, more voices (Polyphonic), more grit, more everything. Variant of the CNT-18. 

### Filtered Chords
Simple unison saw with an LFO on the filter. Make a chord progresseion and automate the LFO sync. You´ll Love it.

### Phoenix-8
A big, spacious synth that can do lush chords, quick stabs and bright plucks. USE THE SPACE KNOB!

### Space Saw
NO need AT ALL for a description. Saw -> Reverb = Nice

## FX

An EQ that adjust itself based on a keytrack modulator. Nice if you are lazy and want to eq some unneeded shit out.

### Ambiance
An Ambinace Preset for the Reverb

### Amp Mk. 1
A little weird Guitar Amp I built.
